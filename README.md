# Netflix Clone

I have been Learning React for a while,  I stumbled upon the latest release of Next js 13 and the app directory.  I wanted to have a crack at it.I thought to myself what project will fit learning next js 13, then cloning netflix came to mind.  This project made me to understand the basics of next js . some of the features of next js i put into use were Server-Side rendering for the Browse Page , Static site Generation for the Home page and incremental Static regeneration for the Genres Page to name a few.
