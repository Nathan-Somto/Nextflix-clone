# Netflix Clone

I have been learning React for a while. Recently, I stumbled upon the latest release of Next.js 13 and the app directory. I wanted to have a crack at it. I thought to myself, "what project will fit learning Next.js 13?" Then, cloning Netflix came to mind. This project helped me to understand the basics of Next.js. Some of the features of Next.js I put into use were server-side rendering for the Browse Page, static site generation for the Home page, and incremental static regeneration for the Genres Page, to name a few.
